# 💰 React Expense Tracker

A lightweight React + Vite expense tracker for managing income and spending in one place. Transactions are stored in the browser with `localStorage`, so entries remain available after refresh.

## ✨ Features

- Add, edit, and delete transactions
- Track income and expenses with a live summary
- Filter transactions by category
- Search transactions by description
- Sort by newest, oldest, highest amount, lowest amount, or alphabetically
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile screens
- Animated transaction list and polished UI feedback

## 💡 Amount Behavior

- Use a positive amount for income
- Use a negative amount for expense

The app automatically shows the expense total as a positive number in the summary cards while keeping the transaction logic intact.
